# RedditVaccineMyth

I have performed Sentiment Analysis on a dataset that has been formed by extracting reddit posts and comments from the subreddit r/VaccineMyths.  

<p> The dataset has been taken from <strong><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/reddit-vaccine-myths">here</a></strong> </p>

### Basic Overview of the dataset:
title | score | id | url | commns_num | created | body | timestamp  

The columns have been described in detail in the Introduction section of the Python notebook.  

### Libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK

Feel free to discuss your ideas about ways to generate analysis and insights from this or any dataset in general.
